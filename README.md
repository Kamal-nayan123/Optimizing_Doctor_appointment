##Optimizing Doctor Availability and Appointment Allocation in Hospitals through Digital Technology and Al Integration.

To develop a digital system that streamlines the appointment scheduling process in 
hospitals by automating the process of identifying doctor availability and appointment slot 
allocation. The system will utilize advanced technologies such as RFID, face detection, 
proximity of Mobile phone, or any other relevant technology to detect the presence of 
doctors in the hospital. The system will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to allocate appointment 
slots based on the doctor's presence and the number of waitlisted patients. This will 
improve the overall patient experience by reducing the waiting time.
